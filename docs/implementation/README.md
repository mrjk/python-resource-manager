The Resource Manager is built around several key components:

1. **Resources**: Core objects representing configurable components with capabilities and dependencies
2. **Resource Links**: Connections between resources (provides/requires relationships)
3. **Dependency Resolution**: The system for resolving dependencies between resources
4. **Resource Manager**: The container that manages resources and their relationships

## 📁 Core Components

### Resources Module
Located in `resource_manager/resources.py`:
- `Resource` class: The fundamental building block 
- `ResourceManager` class: Container for managing collections of resources

### Links Module
Located in `resource_manager/links.py`:
- `ResourceLink` class: Base class for resource linking
- `ResourceProviderLink` class: Represents capabilities a resource provides
- `ResourceRequireLink` class: Represents dependencies a resource requires

### Resolver Module
Located in `resource_manager/resolver.py`:
- `EdgeLink` class: Represents a connection between a requirement and provider
- `DepBuilder` class: Builds dependency graphs and resolves resource dependencies

### Exceptions Module
Located in `resource_manager/exceptions.py`:
- Various exception classes for handling different error conditions

## 🧩 Key Concepts

### Resource
A resource represents a configurable component with:
- A unique name
- An optional scope
- Provider links (capabilities)
- Requirement links (dependencies)
- Additional attributes

### Resource Links
Links connect resources through provider/requirement relationships:
- **Provider Links**: What a resource provides to others
- **Requirement Links**: What a resource needs from others

### Dependency Resolution
The resolution process involves:
1. Matching requirements with compatible providers
2. Building a dependency graph
3. Determining the correct initialization order for resources

## 🔌 Extension Points

The Resource Manager is designed to be extensible through:
1. **Custom Resource Classes**: By subclassing `Resource`
2. **Custom Resolvers**: By subclassing `DepBuilder`
3. **Custom Resource Managers**: By subclassing `ResourceManager`
