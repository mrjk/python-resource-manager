# Resource Manager Library - Introduction

## What is the Resource Manager?

The Resource Manager is a Python library for managing dependencies between resources in a configurable component system. It provides a flexible framework for defining resources, their capabilities, and their requirements, allowing you to build complex configurations with automatic dependency resolution.

## Core Concepts

### Resources

Resources are the fundamental building blocks in the system. A resource represents a configurable component that:

- Has a unique name and optional scope
- Can provide capabilities to other resources
- Can require capabilities from other resources
- Contains additional configuration attributes

Resources form a directed dependency graph, where dependencies between resources are established through provider/requirement relationships.

### Links

Resources are connected through links, which represent capabilities and requirements:

- **Provider Links**: Represent capabilities that a resource provides to others
- **Requirement Links**: Represent dependencies that a resource needs from others

Links use a rule-based syntax: `<kind>.<instance>.<modifier>` where:
- `kind`: The type or category of capability/requirement
- `instance`: A specific instance name (optional)
- `modifier`: Controls cardinality requirements (!,?,+,*, optional)

### Dependency Resolution

The library includes a powerful dependency resolution system that:

1. Builds a complete dependency graph between resources
2. Matches requirements with compatible providers
3. Determines the correct initialization order through topological sorting
4. Validates that all requirements are satisfied

### Visualization

You can visualize the dependency relationships as graphs to better understand and debug complex configurations.

## Benefits

- **Declarative Configuration**: Define resources and their relationships declaratively
- **Automatic Resolution**: Let the system determine the correct initialization order
- **Validation**: Ensure all dependencies are satisfied before runtime
- **Extensibility**: Customize how requirements are matched with providers
- **Visualization**: Generate visual representations of dependency graphs

## Next Steps

In the following tutorials, you'll learn how to:

1. Define resources and their relationships
2. Resolve dependencies
3. Access resolved resources
4. Customize the resolution process
5. Visualize dependency graphs
